            <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning 
            in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections 
            (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 
            This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Prerequisites">
            <header><h2>Prerequisites</h2></header>

            <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers 
                and using the web passively. You should have a basic work environment set up, and understand how to create and manage files. 
                Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_HTML?">
            <header><h2>What is HTML?</h2></header>

            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages 
                you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use 
                to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a 
                hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text: My cat is very grumpy. 
                If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph element:</p>

                <code class="full-code" class="section-ending-code"><span class="code-tags">&ltp&gt</span>My cat is very grumpy<span class="code-tags">&lt/p&gt</span></code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
            <header><h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2></header>
            
            <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section. The anatomy of our element is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle 
                    brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the 
                    paragraph text.</li>
                <li>The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
                <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks 
                    where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Block_versus_inline_elements">
            <header><h2>Block versus inline elements</h2></header>
            
            <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content 
                    that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually 
                    structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation 
                    menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another 
                    block-level element.</li>

                <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the document’s content (not entire paragraphs 
                    or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for 
                    example an <code><span class="code-tags">&lta&gt</span></code> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as 
                    <code><span class="code-tags">&ltem&gt</span></code> or <code><span class="code-tags">&ltstrong&gt</span></code> create emphasis.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header><h2>Attributes</h2></header>

            <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.</p>
            <p>An attribute should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Headings_and_paragraphs">
            <header><h2>Headings and paragraphs</h2></header>

            <p>Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc. 
                Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable. In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a 
                <code><span class="code-tags">&ltstrong&gt</span>&ltp&gt</code> element, like so:</p>
                
                <code class="full-code"><span class="code-tags">&ltp&gt</span>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.<span class="code-tags">&lt/p&gt</span></code>
                
                <p>Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:</p>
                
                <code class="full-code"><span class="code-tags">&lth1&gt</span>I am the title of the story.<span class="code-tags">&lt/h1&gt</span></code>
                
                <p>There are six heading elements: <code><span class="code-tags">&lth1&gt</span></code>, <code><span class="code-tags">&lth2&gt</span></code>,
                    <code><span class="code-tags">&lth3&gt</span></code>, <code><span class="code-tags">&lth4&gt</span></code>, 
                    <code><span class="code-tags">&lth5&gt</span></code>, and <code><span class="code-tags">&lth6&gt</span></code>. 
                    Each element represents a different level of content in the document.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Implementing_structural_hierarchy">
            <header><h2>Implementing structural hierarchy</h2></header>

            <p>It's really up to you what the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. You just need to bear in mind a few 
                best practices as you create such structures:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Preferably, you should use a single <code><span class="code-tags">&lth1&gt</span></code> per page—this is the top level heading, and all 
                    others sit below this in the hierarchy.</li>
                <li>Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use <code><span class="code-tags">&lth3&gt</span></code> 
                    elements to represent subheadings, followed by <code><span class="code-tags">&lth2&gt</span></code> elements to represent 
                    sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.</li>
                <li>Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. 
                    Documents with many levels (i.e., a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, 
                    it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Why_do_we_need_structure?">
            <header><h2>Why do we need structure?</h2></header>

            <p>We need structure because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the headings, to begin with. 
                    (We usually spend a very short time on a web page.) If they can't see anything useful within a few seconds, they'll likely get frustrated 
                    and go somewhere else.</li>
                <li>Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings. 
                    Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</li>
                <li>Severely visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. This is done with software called a screen reader. 
                    This software provides ways to get fast access to given text content. Among the various techniques used, they provide an outline of the 
                    document by reading out the headings, allowing their users to find the information they need quickly. If headings are not available, 
                    they will be forced to listen to the whole document read out loud.</li>
                <li>To style content with CSS, or make it do interesting things with JavaScript, you need to have elements wrapping the relevant content, 
                    so CSS/JavaScript can effectively target it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Unordered_lists">
            <header><h2>Unordered lists</h2></header>

            <p>Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter, like for example, a shopping list. Every 
                unordered list starts off with a <code><span class="code-tags">&ltul&gt</span></code> element that wraps around all the list items:</p>
            
            <code class="full-code"><span class="code-tags">&ltul&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbspmilk<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbspeggs<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbspbread<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsphummus<br>
                <span class="code-tags">&lt/ul&gt</span></code>

            <p>The last step is to wrap each list item in a <code><span class="code-tags">&ltli&gt</span></code> (list item) element:</p>

            <code class="full-code" class="section-ending-code">
                <span class="code-tags">&ltul&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="code-tags">&ltli&gt</span>milk<span class="code-tags">&lt/li&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="code-tags">&ltli&gt</span>eggs<span class="code-tags">&lt/li&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="code-tags">&lth1&gt</span>bread<span class="code-tags">&lt/li&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="code-tags">&ltli&gt</span>hummus<span class="code-tags">&lt/li&gt</span><br>
                <span class="code-tags">&lt/ul&gt</span></code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Ordered_lists">
            <header><h2>Ordered lists</h2></header>

            <p>Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter. The markup structure is the same as for unordered lists, except 
                that you have to wrap the list items in an <code><span class="code-tags">&ltol&gt</span></code> element, 
                rather than <code><span class="code-tags">&ltul&gt</span></code>:</p>

            <code class="full-code" class="section-ending-code">
                <span class="code-tags">&ltol&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="code-tags">&ltli&gt</span>milk<span class="code-tags">&lt/li&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="code-tags">&ltli&gt</span>eggs<span class="code-tags">&lt/li&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="code-tags">&ltli&gt</span>bread<span class="code-tags">&lt/li&gt</span><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="code-tags">&ltli&gt</span>hummus<span class="code-tags">&lt/li&gt</span><br>
                <span class="code-tags">&lt/ol&gt</span></code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Emphasis">
            <header><h2>Emphasis</h2></header>

            <p>When we want to add emphasis in spoken language, we stress certain words, subtly altering the meaning of what we are saying. Similarly, 
                in written language we tend to stress words by putting them in italics. For example, the following two sentences have different meanings:</p>

            <p>I am glad you weren't late.</p>

            <p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late.</em></p>

            <p>The first sentence sounds genuinely relieved that the person wasn't late. In contrast, the second one sounds sarcastic or passive-aggressive, 
                    expressing annoyance that the person arrived a bit late.</p>

            <p>In HTML we use the <code><span class="code-tags">&ltem&gt</span></code> (emphasis) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more interesting to read, 
                    these are recognized by screen readers and spoken out in a different tone of voice.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Importance">
            <header><h2>Importance</h2></header>

            <p>To emphasize important words, we tend to stress them in spoken language and bold them in written language. For example:</p>

            <p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic.</strong>highly toxic.</p>

            <p>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</p>

            <p>In HTML we use the <code><span class="code-tags">&ltstrong&gt</span></code> (strong importance) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document 
                more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers and spoken in a different tone of voice.</p>
