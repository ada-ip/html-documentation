# HTML Technical Documentation Page

This is the forth freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design exercise project. In this exercise you're asked to create a technical documentation page about anything you want but it has to have a navbar fixed to the left for bigger screens, and a main section filled with other sections composed of a header that it's used in the navigation bar, and paragraphs, lists and codes.

## :globe_with_meridians: Why I chose HTML

I decided to do it about HTML because the example offered by freeCodeCamp is about Javascript and I didn't want to copy them, so I chose something that I know. What I didn't know back then is that I would run into a lot of problems with the code tag.

## :computer: The Process

### Navigation

Creating the navigation bar was quite simple, I used a fixed position for all screens and I just changed the top/right/bottom/left position for bigger screens (the navbar is fixed to the left of the page) and for smaller screens (the navbar is fixed to the top of the page).

### Main section

The main section was the hardest part because I hadn't realised that if you put html tags inside a code tag they would be read as html tags instead of just an example. I had to modify the html a lot so it would look right and good.

## :book: What I learned doing this project

* If you want to use the code tag for HTML examples you need to write the examples with ASCII characters.
* You need to write the <meta name="viewport"...> tag in the head if you want mobile phones to render the page exactly as you designed it.
* How to use relative units (em and rem).
* How to use the overflow properties to create a separate scrollable section in the page.
